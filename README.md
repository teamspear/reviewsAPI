# reviewsAPI

The reviewsAPI project is a system design experiment implementing Redis, PostgreSQL, Node, and AWS, focusing on back-end optimization.  The project is the back-end portion of Project Greenfield, an e-commerce site.  The reviewsAPI swaps out the sample data for a more robust data set, over 5million products, each with reviews that can contain photos, characteristics for the product, and much more.
